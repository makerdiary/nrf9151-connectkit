# Troubleshooting

It may happen that you run into trouble while getting started with your new nRF9151 Connect Kit. This page is here to help you solve the most common problems. If you have a new problem, you can [create a new issue] or discuss it on [GitHub Discussions].

## Which COM port is connected to nRF9151 SiP?

The Interface MCU exposes two COM ports, the first one acts as a UART bridge between the host and the nRF9151 SiP, and the second one is connected to the Interface Shell whose terminal prompt appears as __`ifsh:~$`__.

## How to get a compatible SIM Card?

1. __Choose a Provider__: Identify a mobile network operator (MNO) or IoT service provider that offers LTE-M or NB-IoT services in your region.

2. __Request a SIM Card__: Contact the provider to request a compatible SIM card. Provide details about your use case (e.g., IoT deployment, data requirements).

3. __Activate the SIM Card__: Follow the provider's activation process, which may include registering the SIM card and configuring APN settings.
