# Contributing

We're really glad you're reading this, because we would love to have more developers contribute to this project! If you're passionate about making this project better, you're in the right place.

## Before contributing

If you encounter a bug or think of a useful feature, please [create a new issue]. Creating an issue before jumping into code ensures we can discuss it and determine whether it aligns with the direction of this project.

If you want to contribute to the project, regardless of whether it's a small bug fix or correcting a typo, please feel free to do so. Any help goes a long way! Also, contributions aren't necessarily all code related. Other contributions can be in the form of issues, pull requests, discussions, etc.
