# Reporting a bug

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues]. Search open issues to see if someone else has reported a similar bug. If it's something new, [open an issue]. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

When creating a new issue, please ensure the issue is clear and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce it:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files, or copy/pasteable snippets. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** where possible.
