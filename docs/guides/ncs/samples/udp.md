# UDP

## Overview

The UDP sample demonstrates how to perform sequential transmissions of UDP packets to a UDP server.

The sample connects to an LTE network using the [Connection Manager]. Once connected, it sets up a UDP socket and continuously transmits data over the socket to a configurable IP address and port number.

## Requirements

Before you start, check that you have the required hardware and software:

- 1x [nRF9151 Connect Kit](https://makerdiary.com/products/nrf9151-connectkit)
- 1x nano-SIM card with LTE-M or NB-IoT support
- 1x U.FL cabled LTE-M/NB-IoT/NR+ Flexible Antenna (included in the box)
- 1x USB-C Cable
- A computer running macOS, Ubuntu, or Windows 10 or newer

## Set up your board

1. Insert the nano-SIM card into the nano-SIM card slot.
2. Attach the U.FL cabled LTE-M/NB-IoT/NR+ Flexible Antenna.
3. Connect the nRF9151 Connect Kit to the computer with a USB-C cable.

## Building the sample

To build the sample, follow the instructions in [Getting Started Guide] to set up your preferred building environment.

Use the following steps to build the [UDP] sample on the command line.

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Go to `NCS-Project/nrf9151-connectkit` repository cloned in the [Getting Started Guide].

3. Build the sample using the `west build` command, specifying the board (following the `-b` option) as `nrf9151_connectkit/nrf9151/ns`.

	``` bash
	west build -p always -b nrf9151_connectkit/nrf9151/ns samples/udp
	```

	The `-p` always option forces a pristine build, and is recommended for new users. Users may also use the `-p auto` option, which will use heuristics to determine if a pristine build is required, such as when building another sample.

	!!! Note
		This sample has Cortex-M Security Extensions (CMSE) enabled and separates the firmware between Non-Secure Processing Environment (NSPE) and Secure Processing Environment (SPE). Because of this, it automatically includes the [Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M)].

4. After building the sample successfully, the firmware with the name `merged.hex` can be found in the `build` directory.

## Flashing the firmware

[Set up your board](#set-up-your-board) before flashing the firmware. You can flash the sample using `west flash`:

``` bash
west flash
```

!!! Tip
	In case you wonder, the `west flash` will execute the following command:

	``` bash
	pyocd load --target nrf91 --frequency 4000000 build/merged.hex
	```

## Testing

After programming the sample, test it by performing the following steps:

1. Open up a serial terminal, specifying the correct serial port that your computer uses to communicate with the nRF9151 SiP:

	=== "Windows"

		1. Start [PuTTY].
		2. Configure the correct serial port and click __Open__:

	=== "macOS"

		Open up a terminal and run:

		``` bash
		screen <serial-port-name> 115200
		```

	=== "Ubuntu"

		Open up a terminal and run:

		``` bash
		screen <serial-port-name> 115200
		```

2. Press the __DFU/RST__ button to reset the nRF9151 SiP.

3. Observe the output of the terminal. You should see the output, similar to what is shown in the following:

	``` { .txt .no-copy linenums="1" title="Terminal" }
